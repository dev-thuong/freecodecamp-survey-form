# freecodecamp-survey-form
- First required project to earn Responsive Web Design Certification on freeCodeCamp. For this project, I will build a survey form to collect data from my users.
- The project has 2 versions: The github version here is the original version and the freeCodeCamp version (I had to edit my code to pass the Responsive Web Design Certification requirements so the code is a bit messy).
